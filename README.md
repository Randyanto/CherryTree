# CherryTree
This repo contains some Unity scripts I write that are simple and easy for others to leverage. Each folder has its own README to explain the usage in more depth than here. All scripts are being written with the latest Unity 5 and may or may not work in earlier versions.

## Cherries

### Scripting

### Editor

## Usage
Simply clone the repository and open it with Unity.
When you do cherry picking please note that some features may depend on others.
