# CherryTree
This repo contains some Unity scripts that are simple and easy for others to leverage. Each folder has its own README to explain the usage in more depth than here. All scripts are being written with the latest Unity 5 and may or may not work in earlier versions.

## Cherries
Mainly there are 2 types of cherries, i.e. Scripting and Editor. The Scripting cherries can be used in run-time while the Editor cherries can be used to extend the functionality of Unity Editor.
